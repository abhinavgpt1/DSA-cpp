/*
Rotate Array(clockwise, anti by k times)
METHOD 3 (A Juggling Algorithm)
This is an extension of method 2. Instead of moving one by one, divide the array in different sets
where number of sets is equal to GCD of n and d and move the elements within sets.
If GCD is 1 as is for the above example array (n = 7 and d =2), then elements will be moved within one set only, we just start with temp = arr[0] and keep moving arr[I+d] to arr[I] and finally store temp at the right place.

Here is an example for n =12 and d = 3. GCD is 3 and

Let arr[] be {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12}

a) Elements are first moved in first set â€“ (See below 
   diagram for this movement)

ArrayRotation

          arr[] after this step --> {4 2 3 7 5 6 10 8 9 1 11 12}

b)    Then in second set.
          arr[] after this step --> {4 5 3 7 8 6 10 11 9 1 2 12}

c)    Finally in third set.
          arr[] after this step --> {4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 1 2 3}

//we run outer loop gcd times, because gcd gives us distinct/disjoint sets, shuffling in which goes until k==i comes
//{1,2,3,4,5,6} , d=2 -> {1,3,5} & {2,4,6} are the sets, in which shuffling occurs as many times you want(refer inner loop(while));
